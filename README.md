GROWTH HORMONE APPLICATION GUIDE

Simple web application that guides parents/children themselves in daily GH application.

Additionally, a click on the heading generates random animal image which helps to relax the child patient.

In this project I practised mainly working with dates in order to determine correct position for the GH application.

Designed and developed fully by myself based on an idea that I got in a sleep ;)
